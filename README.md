# PyberAnalysis
## Overview
For this project we were tasked with analyzing the data from Pyber, a ride sharing company. Specifically we wanted to look at the data on Rural, Suburban and Urban areas. Our first step was to create a summary dataframe that contained the data on the three target areas, Urban, Suburban and Rural. The dataframe tracked total rides, total fares, total drivers, as well as the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. We then created a line chart that showed the total weekly fare for each type of city. 
## Analysis
We found that Urban cities had the most rides over the given period, but the lowest average fare per driver and the lowest average fare per ride. Urban cities also saw three spikes in march, whereas the other two were more stable throughout.

## Summary
As one might expect, the analysis showed that Urban areas have the highest total fares and most rides. The problem, however, is that their average total fare is far lower than the other two areas. Rural areas, on the other hand, have extremely high average fare per ride, but the number of rides is much lower. To combat these issues, we could use a few different tactics. We might offer bonuses to drivers to go to rural areas, to see if the number of rides went up when there were more drivers in the area. Conversely, we might be able to offer carpool options for our drivers in urban areas, so that we could combine multiple riders into a singular car and therefore raising fare per ride. We could also utilize both of these tactics in Suburban areas.
