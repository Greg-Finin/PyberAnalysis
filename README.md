# PyberAnalysis
## Overview
For this project we were tasked with analyzing the data from Pyber, a ride sharing company. Specifically we wanted to look at the data on Rural, Suburban and Urban areas. Our first step was to create a summary dataframe that contained the data on the three target areas, Urban, Suburban and Rural. The dataframe tracked total rides, total fares, total drivers, as well as the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. We then created a line chart that showed the total weekly fare for each type of city. 
## Analysis
We found that Urban cities had the most rides over the given period, but the lowest average fare per driver and the lowest average fare per ride.
